            Life is so much similar to writing! It is a confluence of commas, semicolons 
            and in some casses full stops too. All these signifies the elements of life. 
            The commas are the day to day problems and situations that we deal with.
            Then there are semicolons, the serious problems which can be a momentary pause 
            in our life, just like it does in a sentence.
            That's what we are up to through this site. We want to let you know 
            that there is more to life after that semicolon in yours! We just need to 
            carry on writing the chapters of our life. There will be only one full stop and
            god will take care of it. Rest there should be only semicolons to remind you that
            you refuse to let yourself down. To remind you that you added more to life!
